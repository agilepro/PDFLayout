<h2>Release notes</h2>

<p><b>April, 2022</b></p>



<ul>
<li>PDFDoc object represents the main document, which contains Frames, which can themselves contain more Frames and ultimately Paragraphs that contain text.</li>
<li>Fully page width frames supported</li>
<li>Addressed some bugs around empty paragraph objects</li>
<li>added programmable space before and after paragraphs<li>
</ul>

<p>the first release.  This library is based on <a href="">pdfbox-layout</a> by Ralf Stuckert and his implementation of the basic frames, paragraphs, and the wordwrap and layout have worked essentially flawlessly.  But I had to fork a new version for a couple of reasons: I needed space before and after paragraphs, I need to implement bullet points, and I needed frames that would extend across the page.  The code I was integrating this into worked in a way that was not quite compatible to the interface provided.  Since then, I have extended the library extensively, but of course, make all the source freely available on GitHub.</p>
