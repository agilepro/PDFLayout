<h2>Release notes</h2>

<p><b>May, 2022</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Table support: new classes Table, ColumnDefinition, TableRow implemented.   Request a table from
    any Frame object, specify column widths (fixed), then request TableRows as many as needed.   Table cells are 
    Frame objects with all the border, padding, and margin capabilities.  Entire TableRow must fit
    on page or it is moved to the following page.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>April, 2022</b></p>



<ul>
<li>Checks for characters that are not in the font, and replaces them with '?' to avoid an exception failure</li>
<li>PDFDoc object represents the main document, which contains Frames, which can themselves contain more Frames and ultimately Paragraphs that contain text.</li>
<li>Fully page width frames supported</li>
<li>Addressed some bugs around empty paragraph objects</li>
<li>added programmable space before and after paragraphs</li>
<li>Added settings on Frame to allow:
    <ul>
    <li>keeping an entire frame together</li>
    <li>forcing a pagebreak before a frame</li>
    <li>setting a minimum space to reserve at bottom of page, forcing page break if too close to the bottom</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>the first release.  This library is based on <a href="https://github.com/ralfstuckert/pdfbox-layout">pdfbox-layout</a> by Ralf Stuckert and his implementation of the basic frames, paragraphs, and the wordwrap and layout have worked essentially flawlessly.  But I had to fork a new version for a couple of reasons: It was not protecting against characters not in the font, I needed space before and after paragraphs, I need to implement bullet points, and I needed frames that would extend across the page, I need ability to force a pagebreak before a frame (without inserting a separate element) and ability to control keep-together on a frame, and keep-with-next minimum space capability.  The code I was integrating this into worked in a way that was not quite compatible to the interface provided.  Since then, I have extended the library extensively, but of course, make all the source freely available on GitHub.</p>
